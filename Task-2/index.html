            <div id="intro">
                <p>I am a recent graduate in Electronics and Communication Engineering from Kl University, I am enthusiastic about leveraging my academic background and technical skills to make a meaningful impact in the tech industry. Throughout my academic journey, I maintained a strong academic record, culminating in a CGPA of 9.3.
                     My education has equipped me with a solid foundation in programming languages such as C, C++, Java as well as familiarity with cloud computing concepts and various AWS services. I have also gained hands-on experience in deploying projects using Spring Boot, creating API endpoints, and doing projects related to embedded systems.
                    My professional experience includes an internship as a project trainee role at Bosch, where I contributed to cloud-based infrastructure management tasks. These roles allowed me to apply my theoretical knowledge in real-world scenarios, enhancing my understanding of cloud platforms like AWS and Azure, and improving my skills in continuous integration and continuous delivery pipelines. 
                    My passion for technology and continuous learning drives me to stay updated with the latest industry trends and innovations.</p>

                <p>My specialization in the Internet of Things (IoT) encompasses designing and implementing systems that enable remote monitoring and control of devices. 
                    I have developed projects such as a smart energy meter, which monitors energy consumption and provides alerts when thresholds are reached. This expertise highlights my ability to integrate IoT technologies for efficient and innovative solutions.</p>

                <p>This project focuses on monitoring energy consumption made by the utilities remotely. In this
                    project we tried to implement an app which shows the status of energy consumption of utilities at our place
                    that can be accessed by us and gives an alert message if we reach the threshold limit. We also used some of
                    the iot related components in this project.</p>

                    <p>This is a project where I used few cloud services. We have used MySQL Workbench to create
                        a database, which we then deployed it using RDS in the AWS cloud. After that, linked it to Spring Boot,
                        where we created the backend code, used Elastic Beanstalk to deploy it on the AWS cloud, and acquired an
                        endpoint. We used Postman to test it. The team will subsequently use this endpoint as a backend API.</p>
